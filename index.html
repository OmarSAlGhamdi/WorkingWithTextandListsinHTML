                <h2>Our history so far</h2>
                <p>
                    For many years Bethany has been making the most delicious pies at her home
                    in 2013. we opened our first store in Brussels (Belgium) and a cozy little street
                    near the grand market. people from all over the world fell in love with the soft
                    cakes, having cheesecake, spicy apple pies... the store became a success in no time.

                    <br><br> In 2015, no less than 100 pies were sold every day and bethany's Body Shop moved
                    into a large building after making a &euro; 2000 revenue. After receiving many requests,
                    it become clear that our next step was making it possible to order pies from
                    the comfort of your own home and from anywhere in the world. You are now looking at
                    the result of this: our very own website, making it possible to order Bethany's
                    delicious pies whenever you feel like it!
